Hello stranger!

Here are the monitoring data for MAGT and ALT used in the article "Applicability of embankment designs that mitigate permafrost degradation in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the Siberian Arctic." You can easily download them from above.

Except for the MAGT and ALT monitoring data, which are difficult to collect from a single source, all other data involved in this article can be obtained from a single source, as noted in the Data availability section.

Good luck!
